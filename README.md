## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: changed colour the colour of h1, p, h2, li and h3. Also changed the background to an image I took in Iceland. 
- **Used HTML tags**: I added a few links to highlight my hobbies as well as a link to some projects. I also added a photo of my face so I am not an anonymous blob. 

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette and used all the colours**: find the screenshots in my repo
- **Used Poiret One font from Google Fonts**

**note: I did not realize that I did not pull request and so this is why it is late. I'll keep trying to figure out this GitHub thing thank you!!!
